# Game Readme
This is my first game written in pygame. And also the  first build of the game.
In this game you have to collect balls using the box BUT, I have not yet developed it to the point where it uses balls and boxes.
So to work around I have started by using a Red box for the ball (that  you have to collect) and the  Green box (through which you have to collect).

The controls are as follows:-

  1. You have to use the left and right arrow keys mainly.
  
  2. You can hold the keys for movement.
  
  3. You can hit the arrow keys (without holding) for movement.
  
  4. You can use the combination of both holding and hitting.
  
 Hope you enjoy!
 
I have developed this game on my own (the whole logic and graphics).
But yeah, I used the help of my Cousin --> "DebmeetBanerjee"  https://github.com/DEBUrocks
where he helped me in:-

  1. Positioning the pygame window in the middle of the screen of my Laptop.
  
  2. Moved the green box in the bottom of the screen to remove some glitches happening in the game.
  
  3. Creating a balance in the frame rate of the game.
  
  4. Displaying the score upto two decimal places.
